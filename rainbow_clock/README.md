# rainbow_clock

This project was inspired by an assignment from Austin Community College's Software Development Bootcamp (June 2021 cohort). I wanted to redo this project because it was one of the first times I solved a challenging problem, but the code could definitely be improved upon.

## The task:

+ Create a live clock that displays the current time with the background color changing every second.
+ Use a new Date object to get the time.
+ Display hours, minutes, and seconds in the correct format.
+ Use of conditional statements.
+ Use of Set Interval method to get the time every second.
